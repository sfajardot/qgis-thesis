## The Overall Project
*Describe Belvedere Glacier Project here*

## Objective of the Thesis Project
In order to facilitate  analysis, a plug-in is being developed to automate the processing section of the data. Functionalities of the Plug-in are:

- Volume change of the glacier from DEMs ?
- Standardized map layouts for certain attributes ?
- Others ?

### Volume Change
To get the volume change there are certain steps required, such as (... Insert steps ...). These will be coded into the plug-in, with (... Insert format checks ...).
 - Input: 2 DEMs of glacier through the years.
 - Output: Raster with volume difference per cell. Absolute number of volume difference.

### Etc.
